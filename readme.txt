Sell and verify NFT event tickets on Polygon. Each ticket is a unique ERC-721 NFT minted to the buyer's wallet. 3% protocol fee per sale.

== Description ==

**Blockchain Ticketing for WordPress** lets event organizers sell verifiable NFT tickets directly from their WordPress site — no centralized ticketing platform required.

**How it works:**

1. Create an event in WP Admin → set date, location, price, supply.
2. Publish the event → automatically synced to the backend.
3. Add `[blockchain_event id="POST_ID"]` to any page.
4. Buyers connect MetaMask and purchase. Each ticket is minted as a unique ERC-721 NFT on Polygon.
5. After purchase, the buyer receives a QR-code ticket stored in their browser.
6. At the event, staff use `[blockchain_checkin]` on a mobile browser to scan and verify QR codes.
