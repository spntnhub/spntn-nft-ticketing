# Blockchain Ticketing for WordPress

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL--2.0-green)
![Chain](https://img.shields.io/badge/chain-Polygon-8247e5)

Sell and verify NFT event tickets directly from your WordPress site.  
Each ticket is a unique ERC-721 token on Polygon — impossible to forge, easy to verify.

## How It Works

```
Organizer creates event in WP Admin
     ↓
Publishes → backend syncs automatically
     ↓
Add [blockchain_event id="123"] to any page
     ↓
Buyer connects MetaMask → buys ticket
     ↓
NFT minted to buyer's wallet (3% fee → protocol, 97% → organizer)
     ↓
Buyer receives QR code ticket
     ↓
Staff scans QR at event door with [blockchain_checkin]
     ↓
System verifies on-chain + marks used → entry granted / denied
```
